# Bayesian Inference on Sleep Quality

**Technologies**:  
- `R`  
- `Bayesian Inference`

## Project Overview
This project explores how stress levels impact sleep quality across various occupations using a **Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Regression** model. Given the increasing prevalence of sleep-related issues, which contribute to $94.9 billion annually in healthcare costs, understanding the factors influencing sleep quality is critical.

**Stress**, in particular, has been identified as a key factor in sleep disruption. Using data from a Kaggle dataset of 374 individuals, we built a model to infer how stress influences sleep quality across different occupations.

## Key Features:
- **Hierarchical Structure**: The model accounts for variability across demographic and health data using hierarchical priors.
- **Stress as a Key Factor**: Stress level is identified as a primary covariate affecting sleep quality.
- **Occupational Variability**: The effect of stress on sleep quality differs across occupations, indicating how stress uniquely impacts individuals based on their profession.

## Results:
The model demonstrates that higher stress levels are associated with poorer sleep quality in most professions, although some roles, such as accountants, showed minimal impact. Trace plots and density distributions indicate proper convergence, making the model reliable for analyzing the effects of stress on sleep.
